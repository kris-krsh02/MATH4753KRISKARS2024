\title{Bootstrap-Based p-Value Calculation}
\usage{
boot2pval(x1, x2, conf.level = 0.95, iter = 3000, mudiff = 0, test = "two")
}
\arguments{
\item{x1}{Numeric vector of data from sample 1.}

\item{x2}{Numeric vector of data from sample 2.}

\item{conf.level}{Confidence level for the test (default: 0.95).}

\item{iter}{Number of bootstrap iterations (default: 3000).}

\item{mudiff}{Difference in means under the null hypothesis (default: 0).}

\item{test}{Type of test to perform: `"two"` for two-tailed, `"upper"` for upper-tailed, or `"lower"` for lower-tailed (default: `"two"`).}
}
\value{
A list with the following components:
\describe{
  \item{pvalue}{The computed p-value for the test.}
}
}
\description{
This function calculates the p-value using a bootstrap approach for comparing two samples.
It centers the data under the null hypothesis and performs resampling to approximate the
distribution of the test statistic.

# Example usage:
set.seed(123)
x1 <- rnorm(10, mean = 5, sd = 2)
x2 <- rnorm(10, mean = 6, sd = 2)
boot2pval(x1, x2)
